# Mento Trading Limits Visualizer

A CLI tool for visualizing all trading limit configurations and their current states across the Mento protocol.

## Features

- Displays all exchanges/pools and their trading limits in a tabular format
- Shows information for both assets in each exchange (including those without limits)
- Provides filtering by token symbol or exchange ID
- Shows netflow and utilization metrics with visual bars
- Color-coded status indicators (green/yellow/red)

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
yarn tradingLimits

# Filter by token symbol
yarn tradingLimits --token cUSD
yarn tradingLimits --token=cUSD
yarn tradingLimits -t cUSD

# Filter by exchange ID
yarn tradingLimits --exchange BiPoolManager
yarn tradingLimits --exchange=BiPoolManager
yarn tradingLimits -e BiPoolManager

# Combine options
yarn tradingLimits --token cUSD --exchange BiPoolManager

# Connect to a specific RPC endpoint
RPC_URL=https://your-rpc-url.com yarn tradingLimits
```

## Display Modes

### Normal Mode

In normal mode, the tool shows a simplified view focused on usability:

- Exchange column shows human-readable format (e.g., "cUSD <-> CELO")
- Technical details like Exchange IDs, Asset addresses, and Limit IDs are hidden

## Understanding Trading Limits

Mento uses a multi-tiered trading limit system:

- **L0** (short time window): Typically 5 minutes for most assets
- **L1** (medium time window): Typically 1 day (24 hours) for most assets
- **LG** (global limit): Doesn't reset automatically, requires manual intervention

Each limit has a maximum inflow and outflow value. When either is reached, trading in that direction is blocked until the time window resets.

## Output Explanation

The script produces a table with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Exchange | The exchange pair (shown only once per exchange) |
| Symbol | The token symbol |
| Limit Type | L0 (short-term), L1 (medium-term), or LG (global) |
| Timeframe | The time window for this limit |
| Limit | The maximum configured limit value |
| Netflow | Current usage (positive for inflows, negative for outflows) |
| Utilization | Visual representation of limit usage |
| Max In | Maximum allowed inflow remaining |
| Max Out | Maximum allowed outflow remaining |
| Resets In | Time until limit window resets |
| Reset Time | Unix timestamp when limit resets |
| Status | Current status (ACTIVE, INFLOWS BLOCKED, OUTFLOWS BLOCKED, or BLOCKED) |

The tool uses color-coded statuses to indicate the current state of each trading limit:

- **ACTIVE** (green): Trading is fully enabled in both directions
- **INFLOWS BLOCKED** (yellow): Deposits are blocked, but withdrawals are still allowed
- **OUTFLOWS BLOCKED** (yellow): Withdrawals are blocked, but deposits are still allowed  
- **BLOCKED** (red): All trading is blocked until the time window resets

## Development

The code is organized modularly to improve maintainability:

- **Exchange Processing** - Functions for handling exchanges and their assets
- **Limit Processing** - Logic for processing trading limits
- **Table Formatting** - Functions for creating and formatting the output table
- **Error Handling** - Centralized error handling utilities
