# Mento BreakerBox Visualizer

A CLI tool for visualizing all circuit breaker configurations and their current states across the Mento protocol's rate feeds.

## Features

- Displays all rate feeds and their circuit breaker configurations in a tabular format
- Shows the associated trading pairs for each rate feed
- Provides filtering by token symbol to focus on specific trading pairs
- Shows breaker status with color-coded indicators (active/tripped/disabled)
- Displays comprehensive breaker parameters:
  - Median threshold and smoothing factor
  - Value threshold and reference values
  - Cooldown periods
  - Current trading mode
- Dynamically sized table for perfect column alignment

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
yarn breakerBox

# Filter by token symbol
yarn breakerBox --token cUSD
yarn breakerBox --token=cUSD
yarn breakerBox -t cUSD

# Connect to a specific RPC endpoint
RPC_URL=https://your-rpc-url.com yarn breakerBox
```

## Understanding Circuit Breakers

In the Mento protocol, circuit breakers are safety mechanisms that can temporarily halt trading when certain conditions are met. Each rate feed has two types of breakers:

1. **Median Delta Breaker**: Monitors the rate of change in the median price
2. **Value Delta Breaker**: Monitors the absolute value of price changes

The breakers can be in three states:
- **Active**: Monitoring and allowing trades
- **Tripped**: Triggered and preventing trades
- **Disabled**: Not monitoring the rate feed

## Output Explanation

The script produces a table with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Rate Feed ID | The unique identifier for the rate feed |
| Exchange ID | The associated exchange identifier |
| Asset 0 | The first asset in the trading pair |
| Asset 1 | The second asset in the trading pair |
| Status | Current state of the circuit breaker (active/tripped/disabled) |
| Trading Mode | Current trading mode (0=active, 1=tripped, 2=disabled) |
| Median Thresh | Threshold for median price changes |
| Median Smooth | Smoothing factor for median calculations |
| Median EMA | Current Exponential Moving Average |
| Value Thresh | Threshold for absolute value changes |
| Value Ref | Reference value for value breaker |
| Cooldown | Cooldown period in seconds |

The tool uses color-coded status indicators:
- Green: Active
- Red: Tripped
- Yellow: Disabled

## Development

The code is organized to handle:

- **Rate Feed Processing** - Functions for handling rate feeds and their configurations
- **Breaker Configuration** - Logic for processing breaker parameters
- **Table Formatting** - Functions for creating and formatting the output table
- **Error Handling** - Centralized error handling utilities

## Technical Details

The script uses the following key components:

1. **BiPoolManager Contract** - Fetches exchange configurations to map rate feeds to trading pairs
2. **IBreakerBox Contract** - Interacts with the breaker box to get breaker states for each rate feed
3. **MedianDeltaBreaker & ValueDeltaBreaker** - Fetches specific breaker parameters for each rate feed
4. **Token Symbol Resolution** - Resolves token addresses to their human-readable symbols
5. **Table Formatting** - Creates a clean, readable table output with proper column alignment
